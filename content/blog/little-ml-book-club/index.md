**We are reading "[Ultra-scale playbook](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/ultrascale-playbook)". Together!**     

Hello fellow ML geeks, my name is Andrey. Each day, I understand more about how little I know. Time to cover another gap - scaling LLM training. Most of the time I just plug in a library or ask an expert colleague. And... I still want to do the same thing, but finally have a much better grasp on what is going on under the hood. Join in!

**How it works:** 
- Read a chapter from [the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/157L7VW-2M1KcwJoRtzadagpJ7LOpos338oEwj8kp2XQ/edit?usp=sharing).  
- Jump on a call once a week on Thursdays at 14:00 (London time) - [calendar with meeting invites](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/2?cid=ZTM4ZmMwYTM5MDhmZjkwNjcwY2EyZDRlNmQzYThjODZmM2I2NzZkMzZiNWExNzc4NWY3MTE4NTk3MDJkNWJlYkBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).
- Take part in the discussion and learn  something.
- Message here if you want to present one of the chapters (pretty pretty pretty please!)
- All slides will be [uploaded to Github](https://github.com/fxlrnrpt/little_ml_book_club)

**First call:** October 30 (Thursday), 14:00 (London time)
