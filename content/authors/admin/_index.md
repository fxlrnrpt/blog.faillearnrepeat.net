Hello, ~~darkness my old friend~~ ðŸ‘‹      
My name is Andrey. AI research padawan & [rock star wannabe](https://notsoalive.faillearnrepeat.net/). Proudly failing at both.     
Love building stuff, exploring the magic of sound, overthinking the incomprehensible, playing with barbells and kettlebells.
